# 🤖 Robotic Arm Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for a 4-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) Robotic Arm controlled using an Arduino Mega 2560 and dual-axis joystick modules. The project is designed as a low-cost, educational prototype to demonstrate pick-and-place functionality using servo motors.

## 📌 Features

- 4-DOF robotic arm movement (gripper, wrist, elbow, and base)
- EEPROM-based memory to store last servo positions
- Joystick-controlled real-time servo movement
- Simple and reproducible hardware design using SG90 servos

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Arduino Mega 2560, SG90 Servo Motors, Dual Axis Joysticks
- **Software**: Arduino Programming (C/C++), EEPROM Library, Servo Library
- **Tools**: Arduino IDE / VS Code with PlatformIO, Git/GitHub
